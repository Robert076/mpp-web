# 🚀 My project for MPP - UBB Cluj

The task given by the teacher:
- select an ***entity*** (My friend Mihai picked *Guns* for me)
- do a ***whole load*** of functionalities I tell you (written below)

---

### 🌎 What I implemented

- A dashboard-style **web application** that lets users register and make `CRUD` operations on Guns and Gun manufacturers 
- A completely working login system based on credentials, using JWT and cookies for safety
- Dockerized the entire application, the code runs using docker-compose
- Deployed on AWS *(however it's not running at the moment due to obvious monetary reasons)*
- Plenty of statistics for my chosen entity, such as *charts*, *filtering*, *sorting*, etc.
- To make the application more secure it makes use of environment variables which are **NOT** pushed here. Nothing important is hardcoded
- Tests for the backend endpoints
- Used Faker to populate a lot of entries and stress test the application
... and many more 😁

### 🏁 What I liked most about this project

I liked the fact that we had the freedom to choose what framework to work in, what type of application to make, what entities to choose, and all the functionalities that were demanded from us to implement could be done whatever you pick.

> 🥳 Although this took a lot of effort, it was a fun project.
